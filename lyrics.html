            Okay, okay, okay, okay
            Okay, okay, oh

            You live in my dream state
            Relocate my fantasy
            I stay in reality
            You live in my dream state
            Any time I count sheep
            That's the only time we make up, make up
            You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
            Now I don't wanna wake up

            20/20, 20/20 vision
            Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision
            I wonder if you look both ways
            When you cross my mind (Yeah), I said, I said
            I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
            You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
            I can only see your face when I close my eyes

            Can I get a kiss?
            And can you make it last forever?
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war
            And I don't know if I'ma see you again
            Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
            And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
            And I don't know if I'ma see you again
            (Uh, switch it up)

            I said, okay, okay, okay, okidokie, my infatuation
            Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
            Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
            I've been looking, stuck here waiting for I
            Stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
            You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
            It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
            Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
            Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
            Yugh!

            20/20, 20/20 vision
            Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision
            I wonder if you look both ways
            When you cross my mind, I said, I said
            I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
            You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
            I can only see your face when I close my eyes
            (So)

            Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
            And can you make it last forever? (Oh, forever)
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Go to war)
            I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
            Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
            And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
            I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
            And I don't know if I'ma see you again

            Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, oh (La la, la la la la, la la)
            Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, oh (La la, la la la la, la la)
            Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, oh (La la, la la la la, la la)
            Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, oh (La la, la la la la, la la)
            One more time?</pre>
